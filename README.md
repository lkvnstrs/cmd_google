cmd_google
================
A hyper-simple way to use Google from the command line and probably the smallest project I'll ever push.


##Usage
Clone the repository, alias to a command, and go! Google search results should open in your favorite browser.
```
git clone https://github.com/lkvnstrs/cmd_google.git
alias goog 'python <WHEREVER YOU CLONED>/cmd_google/cmd_google.py'
goog what is 5 + 7
```
For lasting effects, place the alias in your bashrc/config.fish/other.
